# QA Automation Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on QA experience covering **manual testing, API testing, and web automation**, structured as a real-life QA workflow.

The portfolio demonstrates how test cases, defects, and automation are connected across tools such as **Postman, Jira, Selenium, and GitHub**.

## 🔹 Mini QA Project – Content Review System

**Domain:** Social Media / Content Moderation  
**Goal:** Validate content review logic, KPI accuracy, and API-level validations using a QA mindset.

This project simulates a real content review platform where reviewers classify content based on guidelines and track performance metrics.

## 🧪 Testing Scope

### Manual QA
- Test case design for guideline compliance
- KPI accuracy and regression scenarios
- Improvement vs bug analysis
- Jira-based defect reporting and traceability

### API Testing (Postman)
- Positive & negative API scenarios
- Validation of required fields
- Status code and response body assertions
- Bug identification via failing assertions

📁 See: `api-tests/`

---

### Web Automation (Selenium + Pytest)
- Login positive & negative scenarios
- Suite-based execution
- Pytest framework usage
- Basic automation structure and reporting

📁 See: `selenium/`

---

## 🐞 Bug Tracking & QA Workflow

- Bugs documented using Jira-style format
- Clear separation of:
  - Test Case (Task)
  - Defect (Bug)
  - Improvement suggestions
- Regression test logic applied after bug identification

📁 See: `bug-reports/`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Postman** – API testing & assertions  
- **Jira** – Bug tracking & test traceability  
- **Selenium (Python)** – Web automation  
- **Pytest** – Test execution framework  
- **GitHub** – Version control & documentation

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- Writing effective negative and regression test cases
- Understanding when an issue is a bug vs an improvement
- Connecting API test failures to Jira defects
- Building a structured QA portfolio suitable for real-world projects
